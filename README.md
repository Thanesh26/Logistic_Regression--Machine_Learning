# Logistic_Regression--Machine_Learning
This project uses Logistic Regression to classify sonar signals as rock or mine. Trained on the UCI Sonar dataset with 208 samples and 60 features, each representing signal energy at various frequencies. The goal is to distinguish reflections from metal mines versus natural rocks with high accuracy.
